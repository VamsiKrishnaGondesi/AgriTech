In 2010,around 25 million persons were regularly engaged in agricultural work in the European Union. 58% men were working on full time in farms.<br>2013 saw 77% of the total men were working full time. In case of contribution towards National Income, agriculture contributes more than 50% in developing countries and normally a smaller percentage in developed countries.
