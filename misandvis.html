	fields to provide the report which gives farmer the information required to 
	grow the perfect crop so that he could bear no loss.
	<h3><i>Mission</i></h3>
	&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;We believe in the power of farmers, business, government and non-profits working together to effect the profound change our world needs. We believe farming can be climate smart, deforestation free and pollinator friendly. We believe in protecting water, air, forests and biodiversity. We believe in the inalienable rights of all human beings to be treated fairly. We believe we can transform agriculture for the greater good of all.
	<h3><i>Vision</i></h3>
	&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Our vision of the world is one where agricultural activity contributes to biodiversity conservation and sustainable livelihoods. To make it happen, we work directly with farmers, companies, donors and other organizations to accelerate and deepen the positive impact we can make as partners on a journey of change.
